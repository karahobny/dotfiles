# Emacs configuration
This configuration is valid (atleast) for `GNU Emacs 25.3.1`. Still very work-in-progress and not very easily reproducible by just cloning this directory. It should serve as more of a go-to in varied cases (can't yet say what those could really be).

It's currently dependent on atleast these packages:

* melpa (not a package, but a repository of them)
* company-mode (and its cohorts)
* nlinum
* eshell-prompt-extras
* flycheck (and its cohorts)
* magit
* parinfer
* slime
* undo-tree
* multiple-cursors
* ... and many more (i'll update when i have the time) ...
